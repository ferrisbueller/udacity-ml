    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",
    "\n",
    "|   | someFeature |                    | someFeature_A | someFeature_B | someFeature_C |\n",

    "| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",
    "   - Set records with \"<=50K\" to `0` and records with \">50K\" to `1`."

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "Some observations about the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The number of training examples is pretty decent (36177)\n",
    "* The number of features is also large enough (>100) , 103 after one hot encoding.\n",
    "* The number of features is far less than the number of training examples.\n",
    "* There is some level of correlation among the dummy variables produced (only one of them can hold value 1 for a given sample, the other will be 0). This might interfere with algorithms which assume conditional independence among features.\n",

    "#### Logistic Regression\n",

    "##### Real World Application\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes has been used a lot in natural language processing tasks like text classification , spam identification , sentiment analysis https://www.quora.com/In-what-real-world-applications-is-Naive-Bayes-classifier-used\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "* Low variance , less prone to over fitting\n",
    "* Works best when there's a single decision boundary (not necessarily parallel to the axis)\n",
    "* Works well with high dimensional data\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "* Naive Bayes is based on the basic assumption that the features are conditionally independent of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "#####  Why I chose it\n",
    "\n",
    "* Given that we need a computationally cheap model which gives us good results fast, Naive Bayes fits the bill right away (although absolute conditional independence among features is missing).\n",
    "* It is also said to work better than others when the number of examples/samples is less.\n",
    "* The classes are not very imbalanced which is another requirement of Naive bayes.\n",

    "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050915004469\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "* Works well even when the data is not linearly separable (by means of kernels) (We still do not know if the data is linearly separable or not).\n",
    "* Uses less storage for the results (only the support vectors).\n",
    "* Can be highly tuned via the regularization parameter (to avoid over fitting) and can be saved from outliers using the parameter C.\n",
    "* It delivers a unique solution to the optimization problem , local minima is not a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "* Computationally expensive to train.\n",
    "* Can only be applied to a two class problem.\n",
    "* Model selection (kernel , reguralization parameter) plays a big part in the final success of the model (Can go either way).\n",
    "* Hard to interpret the model (makes it hard to explain to others)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Why I chose it\n",
    "\n",
    "* Since we have a small number of training examples, the computation cost of SVM will not hurt us that much. Also we may be better off using less complex kernels (avoid RBF) or it might lead to overfitting.\n",
    "* Our problem is a classic two class supervised learning which SVM specialize in.\n",
    "* By fine tuning the model parameters later we can achieve some pretty good results out of SVM (while avoiding overfitting).\n",

    "https://arxiv.org/abs/1108.1353\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "* Overcomes the problem of overfitting, as compared to when relying on a single decision tree. Hence improves classification accuracy over the single classifier.\n",
    "* Also does feature selection during training, resulting in a simpler model.\n",
    "* Similar to SVM, can capture non linear separation boundaries.\n",
    "* Does not require a large number of parameters to tweak, hence simpler to implement. Advantage over SVM.\n",
    "* Fast to implement (as compared to SVM)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sensitive to noisy data and outliers.\n",
    "* The solution is not optimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Why I chose it\n",
    "\n",
    "With the advantage of capturing non linear separation boundaries , can be implemented faster and easily(less parameters to tweak) than SVM and results in a simpler model. So sort of a mid-way between time required and the complexity of the model.\n"

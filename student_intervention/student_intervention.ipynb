    "- The number of features are moderate (>5) but not very large (<100) , 48 after adding dummy variables.\n",

    "### Naive Bayes \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real World Application\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Naive Bayes has been used a lot in natural language processing tasks like text classification , spam identification , sentiment analysis\n",
    "   https://www.quora.com/In-what-real-world-applications-is-Naive-Bayes-classifier-used\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "- Naive Bayes is extrememly fast, both during training and prediction. \n",
    "- Does not require a large number of training examples. \n",
    "- Easy to interpret the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "- Naive Bayes is based on the basic assumption that the features are conditionally independent of each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why I chose it \n",
    "\n",
    "- Given that we need a computationally cheap model which gives us good results fast, Naive Bayes fits the bill right away (although absolute conditional independence among features is missing). \n",
    "- It is also said to work better than others when the number of examples/samples is less. \n",
    "- The classes are not very imbalanced which is another requirement of Naive bayes. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Support Vector Machines (SVM)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real World Application\n",
    "\n",
    "Has been used for classification of Gene Expression Data. \n",
    "\n",
    "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050915004469\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "- Works well even when the data is not linearly separable (by means of kernels) (We still do not know if the data is linearly separable or not). \n",
    "- Uses less storage for the results (only the support vectors). \n",
    "- Can be highly tuned via the regularization parameter (to avoid over fitting) and can be saved from outliers using the parameter C. \n",
    "- It delivers a unique solution to the optimization problem , local minima is not a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "- Computationally expensive to train. \n",
    "- Can only be applied to a two class problem. \n",
    "- Model selection (kernel , reguralization parameter) plays a big part in the final success of the model (Can go either way). \n",
    "- Hard to interpret the model (makes it hard to explain to others)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why I chose it\n",
    "\n",
    "- Since we have a small number of training examples, the computation cost of SVM will not hurt us that much. Also we may be better off using less complex kernels (avoid RBF) or it might lead to overfitting. \n",
    "- Our problem is a classic two class supervised learning which SVM specialize in. \n",
    "- By fine tuning the model parameters later we can achieve some pretty good results out of SVM (while avoiding overfitting). \n",
    "- Again class imbalance is low which works in favor of SVM. \n",

    "\n",
    "https://arxiv.org/abs/1108.1353\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "- Overcomes the problem of overfitting, as compared to when relying on a single decision tree. Hence improves classification accuracy over the single classifier. \n",
    "- Also does feature selection during training, resulting in a simpler model. \n",
    "- Similar to SVM, can capture non linear separation boundaries.\n",
    "- Does not require a large number of parameters to tweak, hence simpler to implement. Advantage over SVM.\n",
    "- Fast to implement (as compared to SVM)\n",

    "#### Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sensitive to noisy data and outliers.\n",
    "- The solution is not optimal. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why I chose it\n",

Although, in similar cases with limited resources, cost, small sample size, usually Naive Bayes is the chosen strategy. As indicated by the training and prediction timings, Naive Bayes is still ahead of SVM and Adaboost. However, the gain is not an order gain. All the times for all the predictors are still limited to milliseconds. It does seem that with larger training size, the performance of both Naive Bayes and AdaBoost decreases on the test set, which indicates they are more prone to overfitting and don't generalize well in our particular problem. During prediction, all the models are pretty fast. \n",

    "\n",
    "The idea can best be explained by looking at the figure above. The students in our case represents the points. Each student belongs to one of the two classes 'Will Pass' (Boxes) or 'Needs Intervention' (Circle) . Let us simplify the problem by saying we have only two features 'Feature A' (say Education Status of the Parents) and 'Feature B' (say travel time to the school). For this case we can easily plot the points in a two dimensional space (where the axis represents the two features in a numerical form). By looking at the graph it is clear to us that the two classes form  pretty distinct clusters (proximity of points belonging to similar classes). Support Vector Machine algorithm tries to find a line in this space which separates (runs in the middle) the points belonging to the two classes. Of all the possible lines which perform the desired task, SVM tries to find the line which has the 'maximum margin' from both the classes. This implies that the algorithm tries to maximize the distance of the line to the closest point on either side. As we can see even though Line B and Line C have a great distance from the closest point of one class, they are pretty close to the closest point of the other class. Line A on the other hand , chooses the middle ground , and has almost equal distance from the closest point on both the sides and thus maximizes the margins if we just consider the three lines. So if the SVM algorithm had to choose between the three lines it will choose Line A. When we get a fresh point (student) , SVM based on its feature values determines on which side of the line the point lies and accordingly classifies the student as to whether the student is 'Destined to Pass' or 'Needs Intevention'\n",
    "\n",
    "We can take the same problem to a higher dimension (more features, just as we have in our problem) and the SVM algorithm will try and find the 'maximum margin' separating hyper-plane rather than a line.  The maximum margin criteria works well since by selecting the line with maximum margins we are insuring ourselves against outliers and noise (Points too far to the line don't matter in the final boundary). Also, usually the SVM's work with soft margins i.e. we ignore certain points which are either too close to the line or are on the wrong side of the line while deciding our margins.  The points which determine the margins on both the sides of the line are called support vectors and hence the name of the algorithm. Support vectors can also help us in determining non-linear boundaries. We can transform all the points (uniformly) to another space where the points are linearly separable. Find a separating line in the new space. For any new point, we can transform it similarly to the new space, and depending on which side of the line the point lies, classify it.\n",
    "\n",
    "So whenever we get a new student data, we can feed it to the SVM Model. Based on the class which the classfier predicts for the student, 'Destined to Pass' vs 'Needs Intervention' , we can take further action. The classifier is supposed to give the prediction in a reasonable amount of time (order of milliseconds), and also the storage required by the final model is less (it only stores a linear combination of the support vectors - which are fewer in number as compared to the data points). \n",
